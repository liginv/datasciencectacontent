## Resources for *R Programming*

Here is a list of resources that will be helpful as you progress through the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization's *R Programming* course. One of the challenges presented by this course is that it depends on the hacker mentality that the professors introduced in the *Data Scientist's Toolbox* -- you have to spend some time figuring out the resources beyond the lectures and slides to help solve the problems.

Fortunately, past students have developed a fair amount of content to guide others through the course, starting with the [R Programming](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/rprog/) page on the [Data Science Specialization](http://datasciencespecialization.github.io/) github site.

For assignment 1, [Derek Franks's Tutorial for those struggling with Programming Assignment 1](https://github.com/derekfranks/practice_assignment) is very helpful, along with my articles [Strategy for the Programming Assignments](http://bit.ly/2ddFh9A) and [Breaking Down Pollutantmean](http://bit.ly/2cHyiCl).

For assignment 2, DanieleP's [Tutorial for those Struggling with Programming Assignment 2](https://github.com/DanieleP/PA2-clarifying_instructions) is helpful, along with my articles [makeCacheMatrix as an Object](http://bit.ly/2byUe4e), and [R Objects, S Objects, and Lexical Scoping](http://bit.ly/2dtOSXi), which references an extended version of the Lexical Scoping lecture from a 2003 JHU Biostatistics class. Given all of the challenges people have in understanding this assignment, I have also posted a complete walkthrough of the <code>makeVector()</code> function in the article [Demystifying makeVector()](http://bit.ly/2bTXXfq). 

Finally, for assignment 3, take a look at DanieleP's [Tutorial for those Struggling with Programming Assignment 3](https://github.com/DanieleP/PA3-tutorial), along with my article, [Functions to Sort Data Frames](http://bit.ly/2dxItzw).

A list of other R resources is available at [References for R Programming](http://bit.ly/2b8AxhF). If you have a background in SAS, the transition to R can be challenging. I've posted a number of articles on this topic, starting with [R Onboarding for SAS Users](http://bit.ly/2dr7yum). Finally, if you're stuck, make sure you use the Discussion Forums to get help. A significant part of the learning process in online courses occurs on the Discussion Forums. The more you invest in them, the more you'll learn.

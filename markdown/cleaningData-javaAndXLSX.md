# Common Problems: Getting & Cleaning Data Quiz 1 -- Java and xlsx Package

Students often have problems answering quiz questions related to the xlsx package that is used to read Excel spreadsheets. This article highlights common problems and their solutions.

## 1. Java Runtime Not Installed

First, many students new to the Data Science Specialization have not previously needed to install a Java runtime on their computers. The `xlsx` package depends on the `rJava` and `xlsxjars` packages.  `rJava` requires the Java Runtime Environment 1.2 or above to also be present on the student's computer.

If a student attempts to load the xlsx package without a Java runtime envrionment installed, s/he will receive the following message \(in Mac OSX, similar error will display in Windows\):

After this error message is displayed at the operating system level, RStudio will terminate.

<b>PRO TIP: </b> The easiest way to work around this problem is to use an R package that does not depend on Java, such as [openxlsx](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/openxlsx.pdf) or [readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/readxl.pdf). 

That said, for students who want to use the `xlsx` package to answer the question, there are workable solutions for both Windows and Mac OSX.

<b>SOLUTION (Windows): </b> Downlaod and install the latest version of the [Java Runtime Environment](https://java.com/en/download/) from Oracle.

<b>SOLUTION (Mac OSX):</b> As of newer releases of Mac OSX, this has become more complicated. A specific set of commands needs to be followed after installing the [Java Development Kit]() on the computer. These are documented on the [rJava Issue 86 github page](https://github.com/s-u/rJava/issues/86). I have included a screenshot of this solution for students to reference directly.

## 2. 32-bit vs. 64-bit Java in Windows

Another common problem students may encounter is an incompatibility between the version of the Java Runtime Environment that is installed on their computer and the version of R, either 32-bit or 64-bit.

For example, if one has installed the 64-bit version of R but has the 32-bit version of Java Runtime Environment installed, R will not have visibility to the Java Runtime Environment, generating the same "Java not installed error" as noted above.

<b>SOLUTION: </b> This problem can be resolved by either [installing the 64-bit version of Java Runtime for Windows](https://java.com/en/download/), or by changing the RStudio configuration to use the 32-bit version of R.
